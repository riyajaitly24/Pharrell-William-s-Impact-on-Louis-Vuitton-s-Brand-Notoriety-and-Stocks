    "Our project aims to understand the monetary effects and change in popularity of Louis Vuitton as a brand after appointing Pharell as the menswear designer. For a brand to grow successfully, it is important to track the effectiveness of each business decision by measuring audience perception and receptiveness. Data analysis is a crucial element when it comes to tracking these changes, as you can compare the effects of a brand campaign across different social media platforms by tracking media engagement and sales. These quantifiable numbers give the company a clear sense of the best strategies to implement for future advertising endeavors[1]. When it comes to tracking media engagement, we found that utilizing google trends data to track key performance indicators would be a good way to measure brand awareness. Since Pharell is a well known celebrity, we think it would be beneficial to track social media engagement and measure the volume of likes, retweets, and hashtags of Louis Vuitton.\n",
    "\n",
    "After doing some initial research, we know that Pharell’s debut collection was released to the public around June of 2023 and he was announced as the LV menswear designer around February of 2024[2]. The general public has some sort of knowledge of Pharell’s designs so analyzing datasets of LV stock prices before and after February 2024 would give insight to the public’s receptiveness to this decision and whether or not LV has increased their brand popularity with this appointment. One project that had some similarity with our research question was from winter of 2021 and it measured movie popularity and conducted revenue analysis. They concluded that pre-release search popularity had a positive relationship with revenue. Similarly, we plan to explore the relationship between Pharell and LV popularity and sales. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to research, it has been shown that celebrities and influencers can have a great impact on the perception of a brand or company, especially in an industry like luxury fashion. For example, in Carson Miller’s study “The Fenty Effect: A Case Study on the Fusion of Celebrity, Luxury, and Inclusivity”, it is described how inclusivity in the luxury cosmetics industry was redefined by the Introduction of Fenty Beauty by Rihanna, which led to a highly increased sales and engagement on social media, while simultaneously setting new standards in this industry as this launch included a large range of makeup shades, encouraging inclusivity and diversity in luxury brands. Additionally, celebrities representing a brand represent inclusivity. Zendaya’s collaboration with Valentino challenges traditional beauty standards in the luxury industry. \n",

    "We expect there to be a direct correlation between the appointment of Pharell Williams as the head designer for menswear fashion at Louis Vuitton and the overall increase in popularity of the brand in terms of online searches and an increase in positive sentiment toward it. This is because Pharell is an icon in his own right, with a dominating global presence, and is one of the most famous music producers out there. Appointing him a menswear designer is also a big step in the direction of race inclusivity because traditionally, luxury brands like Louis Vuitton have targeted the rich white community who are typically associated with high-class fashion."

    "Data set 1 includes the stock data of the parent company Louis Vuitton LVMH through dates 2010-04-25 to 2023-12-14. It consists of each date throughout the years ( which is a string variable), the opening stock price of that day (numeric data), the highest stock price for LVMH that day (numeric data), the lowest stock price that day(numeric data), the adjusted stock price (numeric), the closing stock price of the day(numeric) as well as the volume of shares (numeric) of LVMH traded that day. These variables are relevant as they demonstrate the change in stock price of LVMH; Louis Vuitton and therefore its value throughout the years. This will be helpful in correlating the increase in the popularity and value of the brand with pharell’s appointment as the chief menswear designer at Louis vuitton. We would clean this data by converting the ‘Date’ column from string to a datetime format, checking for any missing values, renaming the columns for easier referencing, and filtering by specific dates.\n",

    "Data set 2 & 3 include Google Trends data that captures the overall search interest for the terms “Louis Vuitton” and “Pharrell Louis Vuitton” respectively from 09/01/2022-09/01/2024 in the United States. This data consists of 2 main variables: “Week” which is a date data type, and “LV_Interest” for the first dataset or “Pharell_ LV_Interest” for the second dataset, these are numeric data types. The ‘Week’ variable allows us to track trends in search interest over a period of time, The other variables measure the search interest for each of these terms on a scale of 0 to 100, where a higher score represents a bigger public interest. The search interest score serves as a proxy to gauge general public sentiment and media attention towards Pharrell’s impact on Louis Vuitton’s image. This data will help us understand if there are any shifts in popularity within the company. In order to clean and prepare this dataset we would have to remove any introductory rows, format the ‘Week” variable column to a standard date format, and make all the headers consistent. We will be combining this dataset with LVMH’s stock price data (from dataset 1) to analyze if there is any relationship between public interest and shifts in the financial performance of Louis Vuitton.\n",

    "Data Interpretation: Interpreting \"popularity\" is subjective; we’ll avoid inferring causation where only correlation is shown. Ethical analysis should be cautious of misrepresenting data as direct evidence of Pharrell’s impact.\n",
    "Privacy Compliance: If data is gathered from third-party sources like social media or customer purchase records, privacy regulations like GDPR must be strictly followed. User consent, data anonymization, and usage within intended purposes are critical to avoid privacy violations.\n",
    "Transparency in Data Cleaning and Methodology: To prevent misinterpretation, it’s crucial to document and share data cleaning steps clearly, specifying any data removed or imputed to maintain transparency. This openness helps stakeholders understand limitations and fosters trust in findings.\n",
    "During Analysis: We will implement statistical techniques to control for external variables, such as econometric modeling or propensity score matching, which can isolate Pharrell Williams' influence from other external factors.\n",
    "Equitable Analysis: To promote fair interpretation, emphasize inclusive sampling and highlight any underrepresented groups in reporting. If some customer segments are not represented equally, make recommendations to address this gap in future data collection."
